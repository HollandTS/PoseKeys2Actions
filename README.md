A Simple blender addon that creates an action with selected keyframes.
Works only in Pose mode

Update:

- Automatically enables Fake User for new created actions
- Added a button under 'Misc Tools':  'Remove in-between keys'
(Removes all keyframes in between frame numbers (sometimes models from other 3d softwares add this, removing these can improve performance speed))
